Artificial Intelligence Course Project. Used differential evolution to choose parameter values for learning rate and threshold values of neural networks used in Hand written character recognition in Matlab. This stochastic algorithm was used in conjunction with a custom made neural network that used back propagation techniques to train the neural network. The activation function used was sigmoid function. once a set number of iterations was reached, the ouput was adjusted using a least swuare curve fit that used the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to fit the data to the expected output. This output was ranked based first order optimality values, sorted and then the best population of values was returned
